# VigenereCipherTHOR
Cipher and decipher entered text or a txt file.


You need to implement the Vigenere cipher. Use the text from this exercise (text.txt). The key, that you need to use for encoding, needs to be inserted by the user. 

You need to make a program with following functionalities:

entering the text or uploading the text file for further use,
possibility of encrypting or decrypting the code for the user,
showing the encrypted text,
possibility of entering a key,
if the user doesn't enter the key, use your own name as the key.
The Vigenere cipher encrypts only letters so please include the following extra functionalities:

changing the numbers with the length of the key (if your key is 6 characters long and you would like to encrypt number 2, the result is 8),
encrypt number by number - if you have 2018 in the text, encrypt first 2, then 0, etc.
The program needs to include a user interface, over which we can put in the parameters and show the results.



NOTE:
txt file is on "files folder".
Insert name, key. 
If you want to read a txt insert the name, else leave the field empty and click apply.
